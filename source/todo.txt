Project Estimation/Target ~ 1 - 2 months (was so off on this)
well, to be fair, if I account for actual time worked, then I was not
so off on my estimate, I think I am still in the estimation range
Tasks:

DONE:
- gravity - very barebones version done
- horizontal motion on ground
  - accelerate
  - constant speed
  - decelerate to give impression of sliding
- horizontal motion when falling
  - inertia-like movement when accelerating prior to falling
  - loss of inertia when player was at high speed before
    sliding off and other small movement when in free fall
  - movement and deceleration when not moving in free fall
- Jumping
- Fixed framerate to prevent weird quirks with movement
- Basic camera follower
- move from row-major to column major setup for math library
- Efficient Quad Renderer
- Some way to make and define levels
- Level Creation
- improved player movement
- Added comments to the level file format
- Level completion Object
- Better level format, not having to specify the level element count 
in the level file.
- Added invert gravity mechanic

DOING:
- teleport block mechanic

BLOCKED:
- Audio: figure out what the correct audio sound for jumping will be.

TODO:
- Update camera follower for centering player in view (with limits) after
  a few seconds (maybe like 2 seconds)
- make movement grid based? let's see but probably not
- Implement Broad Phase Collision for efficient collision handling, let's see
- vectorize math library with simd
